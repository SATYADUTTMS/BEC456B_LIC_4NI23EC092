# Expt_1_CS_Amplifier
This file contains the Experiment 1 CS Amplifier files.

MOSFETs or Metal Oxide Semiconductor Field Effect Transistor plays an important role in our day to day life because of its advantages, characteristics and numerous applications.
It can be used as a "Switch" as well as an "Amplifier". These are the 2 primary applications of MOSFETS.
There are different configurations of MOSFETs being used namely 

1.Common Source Amplifier (CS)

2.Common Gate Amplifier   (CG)

3.Common Drain Amplifier  (CD)

Out of which Common Source Amplifier has an advantage as offers a high voltage gain, good input impedance, and a relatively low output impedance compared to Common Gate and Common  Drain .

The below is the general representation of a CS Amplifier.
